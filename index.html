  height: auto ;">Panchayat is one of the best TV series I have ever watched. Not only it truly shows us the struggle of a job seeker student at his/her very first stage of career but also the unavoidable problems of going out and stay in a remote area. The characters are awesome at their acting.</p>

  height: auto ;">It was like they were not acting but doing their normal day to day actions just in front of camera. It also shows us are innocence and friendliness of rural people. In other hand, very very top class cinematography and very good work by TVF production. No bad scenes and very very minimal use of slangs. A totally family series. Anyone can watch with their family. Their is a very sweet surprise at the end for the viewers. Can not wait for the season 2 to come. </p>

Thirdly, dowry pratha not completely vanishing from the rural India With this 3 major take aways, comedy was exactly put into the story, no less no more, just as salt plays it's part, in a meal with plethora of laughs. Making birth certificates to various government policies like family planning and MNREGA, were put into the lineup with light hearted humor. Panchayat is a perfect example of what is required to make a series go with a perfect flow. </p>

Village ideosyncratic people are still unaware of the city life, where people enjoy their so called "Friday nights" in light to the hardships they face in the entire week. Hopefully they are also unaware of the fact, to what a youngster wants from one's life or even feels, as everytime he is mocked for the 20 thousand salaried job. </p>

  height: auto ;">After being annoyed of his frustrated and failure drenched life for the entire time , it seems, being in the middle of nowhere his gradual realisation that he might be getting somewhere, as his eyes getting lit up with the areal view of the village, with his dreams of getting a high paid job in one hand and rinki on the other hand, we just have to wait,which weighs more, or can he balance it ! </p>
